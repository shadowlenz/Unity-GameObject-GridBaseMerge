# Unity-GameObject-GridBaseMerge
 - Merges meshes based on custom unit space in a boundary grid. Prevents large vert counts and less manuelly labor.
Based on Material name and Material _MainTex name to prevent conflict.
 - Supports LOD naming convention. Name ur lod child with a suffix of 'lod_0', 'lod_1', 'lod_3' respectfully. Lod0 or LOD0 is fine too!
 - Messy child structures are supported too ;3
